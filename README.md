## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

During the challenge I got to practice email validation which was the main part of the challenge. I also learned a little bit more on how to work with
gradients. Finding the gradient that it was used for the active state of buttons was a challenge but I was able to use my base judgement and complete the challenge
as best as possible. This reminds me that everything that is needed in order to complete a given design is not always given and best judgment may be used.

Something that I learn while I was doing the form validation was:

```js
if(!emailEl.validity.valid) {

  //code here
}
```
I was not aware of the functionality. 


### Continued development

I want to keep improving my DOM manipulation and Grid layout properties.
